# CHOYCES Mobile App


## Dependencies:

- [React Native Docs (Expo)](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tailwind-RN](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn#readme)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
- Will we need Firebase re-installed later? Currently unknown at this time. See files screens/GetStarted2.js and src/config.js. Existing code written is commented out until Firebase back-end situation is resolved.


## Instructions:

1. Upon fetching/pulling project for the first time, run `npm install` to install all package dependencies. If using yarn, run `yarn install`. Note that yarn files are currently ignored.
2. Run `npx create-tailwind-rn` to create styles.json. TailwindCSS configures and centralizes all style objects within the root directory. See tailwind.config.js and tailwind.js. `npx create-tailwind-rn` must be run anytime the config file is edited.


## Todo list for the mobile app project:

- Resolve repository access
- Cleanup and update the Front-End with TailwindCSS/Tailwind-RN
- Resolve Firebase issue
